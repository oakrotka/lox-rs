# lox-rs
this is my rust implementation of an interpreter of the Lox language from the book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
it mostly follows the book's implementation, but I took the freedom to reorganize the code
to better fit the code style of rust and my personal preferences.
